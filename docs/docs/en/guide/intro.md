## Key Features

**Lightweight Design**

The front end uses TypeScript (Vanilla JS), lightweight and free of redundant dependencies, only ~40KB (gzipped).

The back end, rewritten in Golang (Artalk v2), is cross-platform, compact, and fully featured, allowing for rapid deployment.

**‚ÄúSmall but Complete‚Äù**

<!-- /features -->

We are not exhaustive; more exciting features await your discovery!

**‚ÄúUnlimited Blade Works‚Äù**

Artalk is continually growing; your creativity drives its evolution, and your contributions add value!

Whether it's a front-end project using Vue, React, Svelte, or a blog system like WordPress, Typecho, Hexo, Artalk can be quickly integrated. With everyone's ingenuity, we believe Artalk can adapt to various business scenarios.

## User Experience

We believe elegant design brings excellent user experience, which helps projects go further.

"Ordinary but not mediocre design" - The design tool Figma, favored by professional UI designers, played a significant role in Artalk's redesign. We pre-designed user-friendly, modern interfaces with Figma, then wrote front-end styles to seamlessly blend them into modern websites. This resulted in a simple and fresh interface. Additionally, we designed user identity badges, comment tile/infinite nesting modes, comment pagination, and ensured compatibility with various screen sizes, offering unlimited content in limited space.

"Collapse in an instant" - For unoptimized commenting systems, users might need to repeatedly enter personal information, and their painstakingly typed insights could be lost due to unexpected situations. Knowing that an adult's collapse can happen in an instant, Artalk uses browser caching to auto-fill user information and auto-save comment data, allowing users to express their thoughts with minimal effort.

"Rich site expressions to rekindle comment enthusiasm" - Monotonous emoticons might dampen visitor enthusiasm for commenting. Hence, Artalk comes with a carefully selected humorous emoticon set. Additionally, Artalk supports custom image emoticons.

"Is what you love your life?" - User experience isn't just about visitors; it's also about site admins. Artalk features user-friendly design for site admins, integrating management tools into the [dashboard](./frontend/sidebar.md#ÊéßÂà∂‰∏≠ÂøÉ) in the sidebar. Admin users can easily manage multiple sites, with all data exchanged through standardized APIs and processed asynchronously, reducing data processing blockages and service resource usage. For potential spam, Artalk supports automatic filtering, reducing admin workload and keeping the site clean.

We hope Artalk not only fulfills the basic functions of a commenting system but also becomes a bridge for **knowledge sharers and learners to exchange ideas**, helping knowledge creators realize their value.

## Community Philosophy

‚Äú**Simplify Complexity, Remarkable Simplicity**‚Äù

Artalk aims to achieve **rich** functionality while being as **simple** as possible.

On October 2, 2018, Artalk's [first line of code](https://github.com/ArtalkJS/Artalk/commit/66128e2c8d9a8ac00a8d1498ff0ec035a7727daf) was pushed to GitHub. It wasn't until October 20, 2021, that version v2 was released. Due to a small team and limited developer time, the project's overall progress has been slow. We greatly need the power of the community, whether it's reporting bugs or providing new feature ideas, we eagerly anticipate your contributions.

The Artalk community is an inclusive and open community. We welcome people of all skill levels to help/participate in project development. If you are a beginner, besides actively learning project-related knowledge, you can also try deploying and using Artalk, finding and confirming its shortcomings during use, and then posting relevant discussions in the project's [Issues](https://github.com/ArtalkJS/Artalk/issues) or [Discussions](https://github.com/ArtalkJS/Artalk/discussions) to help developers better locate issues and make optimizations faster. If you are a skilled developer, you can find all the project source code at [@ArtalkJS](https://github.com/ArtalkJS). Combined with this documentation, we believe it shouldn't be difficult to understand. Whether it's optimizing the front-end and back-end structure, implementing new features, or writing community projects, we look forward to Artalk being invigorated with fresh blood.

‚ÄúMore action, less talk‚Äù - The Artalk community does not welcome meaningless disputes. We hope community members coexist harmoniously and contribute ideas for community development. Before raising a question, you should read "[How to Ask Questions the Smart Way](https://lug.ustc.edu.cn/wiki/doc/smart-questions/)", as this may determine whether you get a useful answer. Before expressing an opinion, you should maintain basic etiquette, such as keeping a calm attitude, using appropriate language, and avoiding abusive language, sarcasm, or disrespecting others' beliefs and positions.

As advocates and practitioners of open-source spirit, we believe the free software we create should be freely used, studied, modified, and shared. This project's main program is open-sourced under the [MIT](https://github.com/ArtalkJS/Artalk/blob/master/LICENSE) license, and the documentation is under the [CC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.zh) license.
