# ðŸ“¦ Getting Started

This guide will help you deploy Artalk on your server. Once deployed, you can integrate the Artalk client into your website or blog to enable comment functionality.

## Docker

Here is a simple guide for deploying the Artalk **Server** and **Client**.

### Launch Server

It is recommended to use Docker for deployment. Pre-install the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and create a working directory, then run the command to launch a container in the background:

```bash
docker run -d \
    --name artalk \
    -p 8080:23366 \
    -v $(pwd)/data:/data \
    -e "TZ=America/New_York" \
    -e "ATK_LOCALE=en" \
    -e "ATK_SITE_DEFAULT=Artalk Blog" \
    -e "ATK_SITE_URL=https://example.com" \
    artalk/artalk-go
```

(Tip: We also provide a [Docker Compose](#docker-compose) configuration file).

Run the command to create an admin account:

```bash
docker exec -it artalk artalk admin
```

Enter `http://artalk.example.com:8080` in your browser to access the Artalk Dashboard.

### Integrate Client

Import the embedded client JS and CSS resources from the Artalk server to your webpage and initialize the Artalk client:

```html
<!-- CSS -->
<link href="http://artalk.example.com:8080/dist/Artalk.css" rel="stylesheet" />

<!-- JS -->
<script src="http://artalk.example.com:8080/dist/Artalk.js"></script>

<!-- Artalk -->
<div id="Comments"></div>
<script>
Artalk.init({
  el:        '#Comments',                       // Selector of the bound element
  pageKey:   '/post/1',                         // Permalink
  pageTitle: 'About Introducing Artalk',        // Page title (leave blank to auto-fetch)
  server:    'http://artalk.example.com:8080',  // Artalk server address
  site:      'Artalk Blog',                     // Your site name
})
</script>
```

Enter the admin username and email in the comment box, and the "Dashboard" button will appear at the bottom right of the comment box.

In the Dashboard, you can [configure the comment system](./backend/config.md) to your liking or [migrate comments to Artalk](./transfer.md).

ðŸ¥³ You have successfully deployed Artalk!

## Binary

1. Download the program package from [GitHub Release](https://github.com/ArtalkJS/Artalk/releases)
2. Extract it with `tar -zxvf artalk_version_system_architecture.tar.gz`
3. Run `./artalk server`
4. Configure and initialize the client on your webpage:

   ```js
   Artalk.init({ server: 'http://artalk.example.com:23366' })
   ```
