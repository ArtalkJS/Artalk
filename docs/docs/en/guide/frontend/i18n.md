# Localization

You can select the language in the settings page of the Artalk Dashboard, or set the language of Artalk through the environment variable `ATK_LOCALE` and the `locale` configuration item in the `artalk.yml` configuration file.

```yml
locale: en-US
```

The `locale` configuration item follows the [Unicode BCP 47](https://www.techonthenet.com/js/language_tags.php) standard and defaults to "en-US" (English).

---

Currently, Artalk supports the following languages:

- "en" (English)
- "zh-CN" (简体中文)
- "zh-TW" (繁体中文)
- "ja" (日本語)
- "ko" (한국어)
- "fr" (Français)
- "ru" (Русский)

## Advanced Configuration

### Temporarily Changing Language on the Frontend

The frontend will use the backend's language configuration by default, but you can also set the language through the `locale` configuration item on the frontend:

```js
Artalk.init({
  locale: 'en-US',
})
```

### Automatically Switching Language on the Frontend

You can set the front-end locale to `"auto"` to automatically switch the language based on the user's browser settings. If the language does not exist, it will default to "en-US".

```js
Artalk.init({
  locale: 'auto',
})
```

### Custom Frontend Locale Content

You can pass an Object type to the frontend and customize the locale content according to the keys in the [template file](https://github.com/ArtalkJS/Artalk/blob/master/ui/artalk/src/i18n/en.ts).

```js
Artalk.init({
  locale: {
    email: 'Eメール',
    //...
  },
})
```

By following these steps, you can easily configure and customize the language settings for Artalk to better suit your audience.
