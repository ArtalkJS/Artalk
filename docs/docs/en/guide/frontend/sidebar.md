# Sidebar

The sidebar serves a dual purpose as both a **Notification Center** and a **Dashboard**. Once users fill in the "Nickname" and "Email" fields in the comment box, they can find the sidebar entry button at the bottom right corner of the comment box.

## Notification Center

Artalk features an on-site messaging system. In addition to receiving email notifications, users can also view messages in the sidebar.

The sidebar allows users to view comments related to them, categorized into: Mentions, All, Mine, and Pending Review.

You can quickly locate comments and jump to the corresponding page.

When a user receives a message, a red dot indicator will appear.

Additionally, you can swiftly reply to messages in the sidebar without needing to switch to the comment page.

## Dashboard

For administrator accounts, the sidebar will automatically upgrade from the "Notification Center" to the "Dashboard."

After an administrator enters their "Nickname" and "Email," a password verification prompt will appear:

## Settings

Log into the administrator account to access the settings interface in the "Dashboard," where you can modify [Configuration](../backend/config.md) and [Appearance](./config.md) without editing complex configuration files.
