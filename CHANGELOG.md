### Documentation

* update multi-sites manual ([#747](https://github.com/ArtalkJS/Artalk/issues/747))

### BREAKING CHANGE


For Developers: The HTTP API has now been updated to version v2, with a lot of adjustments made, such as changing to Restful API style, request type, request body, response body, etc. data structure, adding error response codes. You can refer to [#735](https://github.com/ArtalkJS/Artalk/issues/735) or https://artalk.js.org/http-api Please update all your existing clients to adapt to the new v2 server. The new base path is `/api/v2/`. The UI package's HTTP client has been implemented to auto-generate based on `Swagger.json`, and there have been a lot of adjustments to the `artalk.ctx.getApi()` related code. In addition, the HTTP API no longer enforces checks on the header's `Origin` and `Referer` (to implement strict isolation of different sites) but still maintains the original CORS origin check.

For General Users: Now all administrators have the same level of authority (there is no longer super admin authority), the function of assigning sub-administrators with independent scope authority to individual sites has been removed, which can simplify the HTTP server maintenance and implementation. Upgrading only requires updating the client and server application at the same time, and there are no additional operations.

### BREAKING CHANGE


The following top-level functions exported by the 'artalk' npm package have been deprecated: `Artalk.update`, `Artalk.reload`, and `Artalk.destroy`. These methods now require invocation on an instance created by either `Artalk.init` or `new Artalk`. Please utilize instance-level methods instead, such as `artalkInstance.update`. For more information, refer to  [the documentation](https://artalk.js.org/guide/frontend/import-framework.html). The update was implemented to enable the concurrent creation of multiple instances, adapting to situations where Vue components are simultaneously referenced across various pages. Initially, only a singular instance was permitted to mitigate memory leak concerns. However, this proved limiting for scenarios involving the caching of multiple component instances through 'keep-alive.' To better suit intricate SPA application needs, the choice was made to permit the creation of multiple independent instances. It's crucial to remember to manually invoke the `artalk.destroy` method when releasing components to avoid memory leaks (Issue [#660](https://github.com/ArtalkJS/Artalk/issues/660)).
